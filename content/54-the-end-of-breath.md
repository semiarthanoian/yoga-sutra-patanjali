# The End of Breath

> The breath is mastered when - as we remain - the passing of breath in and out simply stops.

If we are doing our yoga excercises correctly then, the side channels open up, which actually cause us to think more clearly and kindly. If we don't get this affect with yoga, then we're not doing it properly.

At the bottom of everything are Self-aware and Commitment, the karmic seeds creating the yoga poses - are we thinking compassionately towards others?

In addition to physical excercises which reaches down to open the channels, there is an entire science of breathing which touches the inner winds themselves, linked to our thoughts within the channels.

Although our breath is not the inner wind, the two are intimately connected. Whatever happens with one resonates with the other. And so in one direction, working on the outside in, we can remain in a meditation posture of yoga or pose and master our breath - which then calm the inner wind.

From the inside out, we can quiet the thoughts - which also calm the inner wind. A totally calm and properly focused mind brings all negative thoughts to a standstill, at which point the outer breath simply stops.
