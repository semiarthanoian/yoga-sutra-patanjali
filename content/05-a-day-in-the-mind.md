# A Day in the Mind

> The mind turns in few different ways: Perception, Recollection, and Imagination.

That is, we grasp almost everything around throughout the day. We use our imaginations to plan or to daydream. We constantly recall on our memories.

The goal of Yoga is not to stop all thoughts. We simply want to stop the Great Mistake, and all the unhappiness it causes. We want to make our minds ultimately clear, happy, and compassionate.
