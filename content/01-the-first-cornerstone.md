# The First Cornerstone: The Chapter On Meditation

> It begins with meditation.

The Yoga Sutra has four chapters - four connerstones upon which it stands, like a table on four legs.

The first chapter describes five crucial steps that we all pass through during our spiritual journey. This journey always begins from pain and suffering: we see death, we see people suffer, we ourselves suffer, we dream of saving our world. And the journey ends when we change, finally, into sacred beings who actually have the power to save the world.

Inbetween its beginning and its end, the roud we travel has five paths. Each one leads to the next. Each one marked by its own special milestone. Stepping up to each new path from the one before, it can only be done in one way. We must be in deep meditation. We must learn to meditate.

Thus, it is that the first chapter on the five paths is called The Chapter On Meditation.
