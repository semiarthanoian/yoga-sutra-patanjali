# Serve The Masters

> Herein lies in the most excellent way of all, the seeds for knowing all things. The Masters are ones as well - whom those days gone by never allowed themselves to be separated from, for any length of time.

The things around us are a product of the karmic seeds within our mind, and so are people. In a sense, then we have our own spiritual Masters.

It's a kind of magic that happens when we've found back our own Masters and commit ourselves to the joy of working closely with a spiritual guidance, serve the Masters and their sacred work.

The bond between us and our spiritual guidance is the most meaningful relationship we ever enjoy. Ultimately, it will help countless other beings.
