# Simply clean

> If we stay clean, then we can see our true-self. All the qualities needed are - Truth, Purity, Compassionate thoughts, Single-pointedness, and Mastery of senses.

If we continue to be very honest with ourselves about the amount of suffering and pains that is really going on around us all the time, then the simple act of walking down a busy street can be overwhelming - hundred of helpless, soon-to-be-gone pass us in a single hour.

If though we maintain a clean and sincere spiritual practice, then the habit of watching out for possible Transcended Beings among us graduates into direct encounter with these beings.

And Transcended Beings really do exist. The idea may seem a little corny, but all the paintings and descriptions of them around attest to the fact that someone has actually met them somewhere.

If the seed thing really works, and if we push it to its limit, then it's stand to reason that we'll eventually be surrounded by such beings all the time.

Mental purity and physical simplicity lead to a serene state of mind, no longer enslaved by excesses of food or sexuality. When the water of a lake is perfectly still, only then we can see the full moon reflected in it - the Ultimate Reality.
