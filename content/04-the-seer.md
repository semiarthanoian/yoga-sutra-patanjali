# The Seer

> On that day, the seer comes to dwell within their own real nature. Otherwise it follows the form of the turning.

The most important day in our spiritual journey is the day that we first stop the Great Mistake. We stop seeing things the wrong way.

It only lasts for a brieftime, the first time. And then, despite ourselves, we go back to make the same old mental mistake. But for a few minutes, we see the way we really are:

> We see that we are not at all the way we always thought we were.

These precious minutes, our first contact with the Ultimate Reality, are thus called the Path of Seeing. Not because we see these things with our eyes, but because we see them with our mind, in very deep meditation.
