# The End of Limitation

> Distant lifetimes, distant places, and distant times - all become entirely here and now. For the thought of them and the karmic seeds from them, assume the exact same form.

We can think about a fantastic traveling spot right now. But it's not the same as being there. It's only a mental picture of being there. So if everything is just mental pictures anyway - why isn't it the same as being there?

When we think about a nice place, a karmic seed has rippended in our mind to "imagine" it. When we are sitting in a nice place, another kind has sippended in our mind to "be" there.

And so it doesn't matter how much we want to be there. We're not going to be there by just wanting. The only way to get there is to purposefully plant the necessary karmic seeds - providing a nice vacation for someone else, then wait for the seeds to rippen.

When mis-understanding stops, the old storehouse collapses - replaced by self-perpetuating pure karmic seeds.

A seer who has gotten very good at mental gardening though - utilizes a powerful inner catalyst of knowledge and a strong emotional urge to help others. They can frame the distant events mentally, and there by, they can reach backward and forward into inifite time with nothing left unknown.
