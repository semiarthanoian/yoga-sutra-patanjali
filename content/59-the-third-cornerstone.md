# The Third Cornerstone: The Chapter on Practice

> Locking the mind on an object is focus. And staying on that object over a stretch of time is fixation.

The third cornerstone of the house of yoga consists of the three inner limbs of/or practices, along with their practicle application. At the end of the last chapter, we were learning to control our senses, which brings us automatically to focus.

On one level, the mind focus on a single object through the process of eliminating all other objects around it: Everything is the reflection of all that it's not.

It's like finding a friend in a crowd at the train station. We check and eliminate faces in the crowd, and steadily narrow focus down on the friend's face. The more faces there are to take out, the more difficult it is to find out the friend.

Once we reach a single point, we need to stay there, threading that path between thinking of other things and dozing off mentally. Thinking of death fixes the first and thinking of our perfect destiny fixes the second.
