# Ending the Tyranny of Stimulation

> Learn to withdraw the mind from physical senses. Freed from its ties to outer objects, the mind can arrive at its own real nature. And with that, we attain the highest control of senses.

We have finished the first four of the five "outer" limbs of yoga - Self-aware, Commitment, Body Yoga, and Breath-control.

Be sure to breath calmly and reaches back. This allow us to be nice to others. And each of eight limbs of yoga support each of the others - creating a self-perpetuating, upward spiral in our world.

Our physical senses are powerful tools. And it's fine to enjoy things. To make serious progress in our pathway to save and serve the world - though we have to learn to manage the senses sensibly.

Do the yoga excercise modestly but steadily. Cultivate silence and enjoy it. Eventually, these will lead to the highest form of silence - direct communion with the Ultimate Reality.
