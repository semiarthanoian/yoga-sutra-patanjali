# The Trancended Beings

> And another way is to ask Transcended Beings for their blessing. A Trancended Being is an ordinary-extra person who is untouched by mental afflictions and by deeds.

It can take a very long time to develop the Five Powers to the point of the pot on the stove. Another way is simply to seek the blessing from Transcended Beings.

There are things we absolutely cannot learn from the static pages of a book, or the wires of a computer. Praying to Trancended Beings is something we absolutely need to do.

Pray for the Transcended Beings' blessing - the understanding of where things are really coming from. Since this understanding is the only thing that can surpressed negative karmic seeds - forever.

No anger, no hurting others, no new negative karmic seeds in the store, and the understanding itself means that negative seeds stored up earlier in the mind will now simply never sprout.
