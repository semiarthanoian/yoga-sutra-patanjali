# The Second Cornerstone: The Chapter On The Way

> Undertaking difficult spiritual practices, Regular studies, and Prayers to Transcended Beings, are ways of becoming whole.

In the first chapter, we use deep meditation to travel through the five paths. In the second chapter, we start some very practical yoga methods to attain this meditation and the wisdom which rides it.

The two chapters together reflect yoga as a union of inner mental methods and outer physical methods.

> Now the whole purpose of meditation is to make our negative thoughts dwindle away.

It's important to be clear about where we want yoga to take us. What goal do we have in our mind? - The first important goal is nirvana.

This is not some stuperfied numbness, but refers rather to permanently stopping all our negative thoughts. Imagine ourselves as a person who is simply not capable of getting angry, ever again.

After reaching this nirvana, we work further to become a transcended being - who sees all things, know all things, and is capable to help all people at once.

In fact, the Sanskrit word for "the way" here is "sadhana", which means "to reach". We reach our perfect destiny firstly by prayers to Transcended Beings and secondly by becoming one of them.
