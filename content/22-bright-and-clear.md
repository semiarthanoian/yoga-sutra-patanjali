# Bright and Clear

> This practice makes the mind bright and clear like crystal. It gives the same effect as releasing the breath.

A daily meditation on the Four Infinite Thoughts changes our entire life. It gives our life real and lasting meaning.

It makes our mind feel bright and clear when we hear someone say that our real purpose in life is to strive for the capability to help countless other living beings.

And not with that kind of helps that will themselves quickly be used up and disappear. We were all meant for more.

> It also helps us control the tendency that we have - of thoughts constantly arising about outer objects.

The physical yoga excercises and the special breathing techniques that go with them, are meant to open up the subtle inner channels.

But because the thoughts themselves travel in these channels, we can get the same result - a lot more quickly and easily - by simply thinking the Infinite Four Thoughts.
