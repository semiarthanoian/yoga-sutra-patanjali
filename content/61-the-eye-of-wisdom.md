# The Eye of Wisdom

> When these three act together as one, we call it - the combined effort. When we master this skill, we gain the eye of wisdom. This is considered in various levels.

The combined effort and the ability to keep the mind in that state one hour or more unwavering - represent a truly powerful instrument, the one and only, which can heal the suffering of our world. It is called the eye of wisdom - a metaphorical third eye - the light of knowledge within our deepest mind.

The combined effort begins as an intellectual experience and then become the eye of wisdom - a direct experience of Ultimate Reality. But even they are the mind of a child compared to where they will take us.
