# Gaining Control of Our Lives

> Deeds are done by a true practitioner are pure - neither good nor bad.

Gardening our reality means taking back control over our lives. It means knowing exactly how to get the things we need. Because we now understand precisely which karmic seeds to plant and how they will ripen. And this is the true practice of all types of yoga.

Most of us are constantly and blindly planting three kinds of karmic seeds in our mental garden:
- many moment-to-moment little black, negative ones,
- a lot of neutral ones,
- and occasional nice white ones from helping someone else.

True practitioners do the same good deeds with understanding. Instead of planting impure white or black karmic seeds, they plant only pure ones. And thus, they run their lives by themselves.
