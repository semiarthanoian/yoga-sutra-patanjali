# Chokepoints and Chakras

> Turn the same effort upon the wheel at the navel, we can understand the structure of the body.

As they follow the center channel up the body, the two side channels twist around it at certain spots, like vines. This create chokepoints which obstruct the flow of the center channel.

Looking down the spine, these are seen radiating out like the spokes of a wheel. Thus they are called chakra(s) - a Sanskrit word for "wheel".

The first wheel was formed in the womb and it's located at the navel. Eventually, an entire network of energy channels was developed, then the very structure of our skeleton, blood vessels, and nervous system forms around the channels.

This means that any physical ailment we ever have can be traced to the channels, and cured with understanding.

> Turning this understanding upon the chakra at the neck allows us, in time, to overcome the need to eat and drink.

And we can gradually control all five physical senses which are tied to five secondary inner winds called "turtle" winds - respnsible for our turtle-shaped liver.
