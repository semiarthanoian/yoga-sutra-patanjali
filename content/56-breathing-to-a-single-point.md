# Breathing to a Single Point

> The fourth step is when one has given up the outside, inside, and the experience itself. And then one can dissolve the veil that covers the light. The mind is fit for focus.

So the breath can be outside, inside, or experienced as moving between the two. But there's also the fourth possibility, when it stops altogether.

The closer we concentrate, the more calm the inner winds become - and thus the breath.

When the breath actually stops for long periods of time, it does so for one or two reasons:
- either our focus in general is perfect,
- or we have dissolved the very thoughts and inner winds that create the veil of the Great Mistake.

Of course, the first one can get us to the second. But it's the second one that we want. That's what Master Patanjali defined as yoga itself, back in the beginning.

All the practices of yoga are aim at stilling the side channels, which cause us to see the ultimate reality, and turns our body into light - a Transcended Being who appears when someone needs.

The result of Body Yoga and esspecially - the breath excercises - come only with a steady work and guided by Transcended Beings. So, don't try to force things ourselves.

Success comes very surely and naturally with the body of Self-aware and Commitment.
