# Where Things Come From ?

> Negative thoughts are the very root of the storehouse, planted by the things we do. And then we experience things in lifetime we see or not. As long as this root is still there, then we will experience the ripening of these actions in our lives to come.

Assume that we are at the last maple-coated donut of a store. We see it as something left in the store and we can get it with some money, not from our karmic seeds. We want it in a way that's mistaken about how to get it.

And so rather than taking care to plant seeds for a donut - by stopping buying and leaving it for the elder people behind - we buy the last donut. This forces the issue and thereby create an unhappy "karma".

Our system is like and extra-ordinary recorders that records every act, word, and thought we ever undertake, every second of our entire life. The record of each action is stored as a karmic seed. When the right time comes, the seed ripens and creates everything around and inside us.

This storehouse of karmic seeds decides what we see now, and also what we see where we can't see yet - after we die. Don't be naive and believe that thougths will simply stop because the body stops. If we don't get a call from someone, maybe their phone is just broken.

We all have lots of negative karmic seeds. Only true knowledge can stop them from every sprouting.
