# Where Suffering and Pains Come from ?

> There is a connection of causes and effects. The karmic seeds ripen into experiences refreshingly pleasant or painful in their torment.

Take a moment of total honesty and ask ourselves where the suffering and pains in our life come from. There're basically three choices.

## The first

It's about the Big-bang Theory. All things have been caused by an event that conveniently has no cause itself. Our life and all its tragedies are simply a huge coincidence.

## The second

There is a higher and infinitely compassionate intelligence which has created everything, and created it in such away that we always lose everything to the agonies of old age and death.

## The last

It's about the causes and effects. We get exactly what we give to others.

> All this, by the way, is not to say that there are no Transcended Beings hovering around us constantly, guiding us towards perfect happiness. There are, but still it cannot come unless we take care of others.
