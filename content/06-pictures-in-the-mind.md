# Pictures in the Mind

> Imagination is a mental impression that follows a word, and is devoid of any concrete basis.

When we plan to meet a person, we see in our mind the general outlook and face of that person, although it doesn't yet correspond to the concrete person. The words "who's to hangout" inspire the pictures in our imagination.

> Recollection is the ability not to forget an object which we have experienced.

When we have a memory of something, again there is no outer object; There's just an approximate picture in the mind, sort of a shorthand note to remind us of something.

> And so in the course of an entire day, our mind wends its way through different outside objects, and insides images or thoughts.

Unless we truly understand things - the Yoga's way - then every single perception and imagination we ever have is infected by the Great Mistake.

Feelings, strong feelings, come up about the things we think we see - and the child beats his fist against the man on the movie screen.
