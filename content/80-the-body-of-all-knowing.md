# The Body of All Knowing

> If we turn the combined effort upon the fact that - the sense which hold onto objects also follow their true nature, their real self - then we can master the power of senses. Thus then we can also master that thing which takes the aspect - the main thing, the swift messenger of the mind.

So far we have attained three bodies:
- the "emptiness" body, which make all other ones possible,
- a physical body, that we send out in infinite forms,
- another physical body, that we stay in ourselves, within our heaven.

The fourth layer is then the body of what our mind will become. Our sense powers take ahold objects, and then report back to the mind. The mind is like a mirror, assuming the form of aspect of whatever the sense present to it.

It takes a split-second for the mind to identify the objects presented to it - including organizing thought-sounds into thought-words. So in one way, we're always a split-second behind what's going on around us. But the principle character - the mind is so quick that we never notice.

Understanding the true nature of every part of this process is that - it's still coming from the mind. This allows us to reach the fourth body - the body of all knowing.
