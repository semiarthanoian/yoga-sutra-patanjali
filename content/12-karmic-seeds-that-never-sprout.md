# Karmic Seeds That Never Sprout

> That type where you still have unripe seeds but where - because of your practice - the factor is surpressed forever.

We have billions upon billions of seeds in our minds, planted there by hurting or taking care of those around us. When the time is right, individual karmic seeds sprout up in our minds at about the speed of the number of frames in a movie, and we watch the stream of our life unfold.

The factor that makes negative seeds sprout is simply seeing things the wrong way. When we practice meditation well and avoid meditation traps, we can prevent karmic seeds from sprouting.

> Those who stay in that nature, in the factor of becoming, take the same gross physical body.

Our experiences about the body getting old because negative karmic seeds are sprouting. The experience about the dead of the body comes from a karmic seed sprouting too. Here in lies the secret of the Elixir of Life.

When karmic seeds are about to sprout, we call it "becoming". This is triggered by staying in our same old nature - seeing the wrong way things really are.

The karmic seeds are what gave us a mortal body in the first place, and we can change that - if we change the seeds.
