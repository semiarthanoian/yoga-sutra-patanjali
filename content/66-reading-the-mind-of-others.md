# Reading the Mind of Others

> With the necessary cause, one can read the mind of others. This though is not done through the one they're based in, because it would not be their own experience.

In the hours after communicating with the Ultimate Reality, we temporarily gain the ability to read others' mind. As we progress through the next path, the ability becomes more and more stable.

It's not that we can share the same karmic seeds which are based or located in others. Seeds in our own mind can only be put there by our own actions.

If this were not the case, then we simply wouldn't be here in this broken world. Masters of the past, in their infinite compassion, would have given us their own perfect karmic seeds long ago.

Reading others' mind is an important skill if we have some precious lessons to share. We can peak in and see what others enjoy, what others hope for, and their capacity to diggest ideas.
