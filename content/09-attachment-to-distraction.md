# Attachment to Distraction

> Giving up attachment to distraction consists of decision to gain control over craving for experiences, seen, or only heard of.

It is our destiny, each one of us, to save our world. Yes, we can and we will. Deep inside us, we know this is what we want to do.

And so we step on the first of the five paths. It's called the Path of Accumulation - piling enough good karmic seeds to change ourselves and so our world.

Now we will no longer have anytime for meaningless distractions. We must simplify our lives, concentrate on what's really important. No more time to waste on newspaper and television.
