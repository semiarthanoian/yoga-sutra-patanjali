# In Our Presence

> If we make it a way of life never to hurt others, then in our presence, all conflicts come to an end.

What happens if we get good at managing our karmic seeds? Remember first that only we can plant our own seeds, and only we experience them when they sprout.

We can also do a good thing through as a group, and each person in that group plants a similar karmic seed. This accounts for the prosperity and poverty that exist on opposite side of our imaginary international borders.

The more thoughtful and steadily we work with our own karmic seeds, instead of trying to wrestle with the man on a movie screen, the more obvious it becomes that now we are on the right track.

- The first stage is the surprising - a person who's a problem at work greets us warmly.
- Then, the obvious - almost everybody at work starts to smile at us.
- Next, the amazing - wars around the world suddenly stop because we have moved to another sphere of existence which is represented by different bundle of karmic seeds.
- Finally, the miraculous - the process of our body aging clearly stops and begins to reverse itself.
