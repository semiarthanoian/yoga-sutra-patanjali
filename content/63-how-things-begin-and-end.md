# How Things Begin and End ?

> Moving the focus on a single object towards all objects - is called the transformation of meditation. It is where that state of mind ifself either rest or arises, according to the karmic seeds.

So, we may experience deep states of meditation where our mind seems to be stopped. It's important to understand the experience and transform it into something - that can really help us.

The question is - how long we can stay in the state where the Great Mistake has stopped?

For the first time, we can stay for a few minutes only. The stopping stops when our pure karmic seeds are still too fragiled. Other powerful fragile seeds have maintained both the single-pointed stillness and wisdom.

During the experience, we transform our suffering and pains as well by realization. But the realization can only last as long as the karmic seeds do. This, in turn, sends us back to work on the first two limbs of yoga - Self-aware and Commitment.
