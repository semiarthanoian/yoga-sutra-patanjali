# Respecting Our Destiny

> And there will come a time when they invite us to take our place with them. We must become a source of cares for our beloved people, or we'll fall victim to all we sought to avoid.

The moment we first pickup this book, we attracted the attention of some very important people - everyone who has studied the book in the last two thousand years, and practiced to become a Transcended Being.

Simply by thinking the idea we've read about so far, we become a part of certain family of people:
- who very concern about the suffering and pains of the world,
- who have the spark of high wisdom within them,
- who believe that there must be a key to stop death and unhappiness together.

As our powers grow, and we evolve, all of our physical and emotional pain will begin to dissolve. There's a point at which we may get trapped thinking to stop at that.

But then, these important people will show themselves to us, and invite us to their family - which acts only for true happiness of the entire family of all living kinds.

We've said that we had to understand the understanding itself. That urge itself is coming from the karmic seeds too. And the only seeds it can come from are planted by wanting to save all the rest of us.
