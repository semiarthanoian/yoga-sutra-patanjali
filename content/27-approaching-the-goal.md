# Approaching The Goal

> The distinction between what we refer to as being involved with examining or not being involved examining, more over, has to do with the relative subtlety of the object.

The day after we see the Ultimate Reality, we are on the fourth path - the Path of Habituation. It's called this because we are getting used to what we saw - using that indescriable experience to complete the work of dissolving negative karmic seeds in our mind forever.

The content of our meditation, the object upon which we use this powerful tool to focus, must be that one most meaningful and subtle object of all.
