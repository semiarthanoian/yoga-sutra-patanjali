# The Clear Light

> Perfect meditation, then see this same object as simple as itself - it's clear light and totally void of any true nature of its own.

At some point, through a modest and very regular daily practice of meditation, and blessed by the Masters, we can attain total stillness of the mind - focus and fixed.

The Great Mistake is like a big tree. Perfect focus and the ability to stay are like two strong arms. But however strong we may be, we can't simply push the tree down. We need a good tool - the understanding of something important.

As we meditate, we need to strive to see that, even the joy of discussing a topic is not from the topic itself - it is us to make the discussion joyful.
