# The Power Of Compassion

> We will now review how we become whole.

Another meaning of Yoga is to become whole. Ultimately, we can only become whole when we are truly capable of helping others with the things that really matter - when we can help others understand: how we came into this world, what life is for, and whether it has to end with losing everything.

This then, said Master Patanjali, is why this short book is writtern. He wants us to know, from the very beginning, that this book contains something of ultimate importance, something worth the precious hours of our life.

And we will only review, said the master, what his holy teachers had told. He left his own pride:

> I have nothing new to tell you, and there is nothing here that I have made up myself. I am only a vessel for the wisdom of the ages, and I pass it onto you - tried, tested, and experienced.  
> _Master Patanjali

And he said: "I will write this book, for once a master promises to do something, they do it - or die trying it."

All the great book of India begins with these three noble themes: their power, their karma, and stops all obstacles to the work now we begin.
