# The Deeper Powers

> It more over enables us to stay conscious in our dream when we have to sleep.

We've talked about how our world is the product of the karmic seeds within our own mind. The quality of just wanting to help another person alter these seeds drastically.

And the wish to help infinite numbers of people - even if it's only a wish, a very feeble wish - has the power to transform all the karmic seeds within our minds. This then transform - well - everything there is, everywhere.

Naturally, this affect spreads to all those states of mind we go through in a normal day. The act of sleep itself becomes an adventure - we're as lucid in dreams as we are in our everyday life. And we may use our sleeping hours to explorer and improve our mind and stored karmic seeds.

> It brings us to the same exhilaration as deep meditation does.

If meditation can bring us a kind of bliss, then simply standing, sitting, lying somewhere and thinking the Four Infinite Thoughts can bring us the same bliss.

> We may gain mastery over tinies atoms and hugest galaxies as well.

As the seeds in our mind transform, we suddenly become very good at anything we try to do - whether small exacting tasks or monumental projects.

As this process continues, we even gain the power to actually enter and alter processes of sub-atomic to galactic levels - if that would help somebody.
