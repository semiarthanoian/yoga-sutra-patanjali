# Beyond All Fear

> When we gain the fearlessness of going beyond all examining, we reach inner bliss. At this point, wisdom becomes vast and awakened.

As we travel along the Path of Habituation, we eliminate within ourselves, forever, all negative thoughts like anger, jealously, or wanting things ignorantly. The last negative thought that we will overcome is even the most subtle form of examining or seeing things the wrong way.

> We experience a completely different object than with the wisdoms of hearing and reasoning, because what we see is far beyond.

Once all negative karmic seeds are gone, we progress through the final steps toward total purity. This period is devoted to gain the ability to see everything in the universe - whether past, present, or future - at the same time.

When we reach total purity though, we blissfully see everything in both realities, even with our ears, fingers, or other senses.

This is the final goal - the fifth path - the Path of No More Learning. We can be beyond all fear. We have reached our goal through a careful process of learning from Transcended Beings and considering well what they say. Now we experience it directly.
