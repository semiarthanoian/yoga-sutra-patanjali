# The Path of Diamond

> Those extra-ordinary people who shatter the way the mind turn things around, use a balanced meditation, which is fixed and clear on its object.

The most important moment of our life is when we see the Ultimate Reality for the first time at the Path of Seeing. It changes us forever, and brings us to the very verge of our goal.

This path cannot occur unless first we are staying in the state of meditation with a total clear and focused mind: balanced, free of two extremes of dullness and hyper activity.

> And the object is like a crystal, with the one that holds it, and what it holds, and the holding itself as well.

The Ultimate Reality lies all around us now, but beyond our perception, clear as diamond. In fact, everything there is, everywhere, posses its own Ultimate Reality - just as every spliter of diamond which is simple and perfectly pure.
