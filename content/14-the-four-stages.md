# The Four Stages

> The goal is reached by those who acts with intense dedication and urgency.

On the Path of Preparation, we will pass through four stages which prepare us for te next path. These four stages are: Warmth, Peek, Mastery, and the Highest Object of All.

The four stages represent a growing realization of the Great Mistake - a growing understanding of where things are really coming from.

The stages begin with an appreciation of how objects in the world around us might be coming from themselves. In the end, we turn this understanding inward, upond our mind.

Our spiritual skills will develop to a higher degree at each stage:

- Turning from Five Powers
- Into the Five Peeks
- Then the Five Strengths
- and finally the Five Highest Objects.

A person at the end of the fourth stage, might be watching a pot of water on the stove. They suddenly realize that they are watching an impossibly perfect, tiny picture of a pot within their own mind.
