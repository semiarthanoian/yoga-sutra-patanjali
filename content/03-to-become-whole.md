# To Become Whole

> We become whole by stopping our mind turns.

These are perhaps the most important words of the entire Yoga Sutra. Here the Master tells us another meaning of Yoga, which is learning to stop the Great Mistake.

And what is the Great Mistake? "Our mind turns" means it turns things around the wrong way.

A mother takes her small child to a movie. The child doesn't like an action of a man on the screen and reaches to stop the man. Perhaps the child can even get up and try to hit the man. But it doesn't stop the man, it as nothing to do with the man. And the child hurts his own hand in the process.

Our mind makes this same kind of mistake, every moment, every day. We need to stop the mistake, and that is Yoga.

Pain is real, suffering is real - yes. But we can only stop it if we stop misunderstanding where it comes from. And that's what Yoga Sutra teaches us to do.
