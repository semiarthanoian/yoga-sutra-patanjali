# The Body of Light

> Those who no longer perceive anything as being outside - experience the transformation into the ultimate body. With this, every veil which covers the light is dissolved.

> Turn the combined effort upon the fact that the gross body is an object which comes from subtle nature, and we can gain mastery over the elements.

These lines mark the point at which he combined effort of stillness and understanding has been sustained for so long. And then the seers experience the final transformation into a light being who can serve all worlds - a transcended being with four layers of the light body.

In a way, we already possess the first body of the transcended, and we always have. It is the simple fact that we are not what we are - the person with the given name. Rather the karmic seeds of name and picture - came first and made us think that we are thoses.

Since we are not the self anyway, we are available to transcend into a light being. And we always have been. The body of light is our true and very first body.

When we grasp that - the way we look, our physical appearance - is also available in the same way, we begin the hard work of planting enough karmic seeds to change the actual physical elements of our body into those of a Transcended Being.
