# The Eight Limbs

> If we engage earnestly in the various practices of making ourselves whole, all of our impurities will be destroyed. And then we will gain the light of wisdom, a revelation beyond even discrimination.

For seven higher levels, then we see the illusion as an illusion, and finally stop things from even looking other than they really are coming from our own seeds.

We then embark on three final stages known as "pure levels", where we learn to know all things and to send ourselves out to guide people in many places at once.

Our wisdom here is beyond needing to stay mindful even of the illusion. This then is the Four and Final Higher Truth - the Truth of the End of Pains and Suffering.

> The Eight Limbs are: Self-aware, Commitments, Yoga-poses, Breath-control, Senses-guard, Focus, Fixation, and Perfect-meditation.

The brilliance of Master Patanjali's book on Yoga - the reason it has survived thousands of years - is that it now gives us a very practical, step-by-step guide - which all of us, regardless of our abilities or circumstances we live in, can undertake right now to gain these goals.
