# Approaching the Door

> Stopping the Great Mistake requires constant practice, giving up attachments, and striving to be there - the first nirvana.

The way to stop the Great Mistake is to work our way through all five paths.

We reach the first path by giving up our attachments, and it requires developing the habit of constant practive - the willing to work very hard to reach our perfect destiny.

We will never be able to complete all the hard work needed if we don't have a very strong motivation. The motivation comes to all of us at some point in our lives. Most often it is some kind of personal/global disaster or tragedy.

It is our destiny to heal our world.

We begin with a daily inner practice. It includes three essential elements:
- Being careful never to hurt others;
- Learning to meditate and pray;
- And relentlessly exploring the question of where things really come from.
