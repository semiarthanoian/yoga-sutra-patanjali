# Beginning of Self

> Selfness is the wrong impression of someone seeing something and the thing someone sees - which makes it seem as if the observer and the observed were separated things.

We enter life with the seed of ignorance within us. And then in the very womb, the karmic seeds flowers into a personal experience of this mis-understanding, which is here called "selfness".

This wrong idea of "me" is awakened by our very first sensations in life. Inflicted by ignorance, the mind immediately splits life into "feeling" and "me feeling".

> It's very important to say here that there is a "me" which is perfectly fine - one which does exist and experiences other things. So what's the difference between this "me" and the one which causes all the troubles?

When we experience something, we tend to think of it as something out there, on its own, and by itself. But, in fact, the experience and the "me" are being produced by those seeds within our mind.

We can see this from the fact that the same object will give different experiences to different people, or exactly to different bundle of karmic seeds.
