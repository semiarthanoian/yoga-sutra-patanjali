# Everything We See

> The cause to be eliminated is the interaction between the seer and what they see.

Here begins the Third Higher Truth - the Truth to the Path to the End of Suffering and Pain. Let's take a glance at the Way the Universe itself is organized, and look for clues on how to stop the Great Mistake, the cause of all suffering and pains.

Everything we see around us - is either at work or at rest. Things that work, or do something, change thereby. A few things, like the empty space that things stand in, never change.

Our experiences of the body are ever changing, a combination of physical elements, like chemicals, powers of senses, and psychological processes.

> What we see, what appears to us, is the state of all things, something to take in or to use for our liberation.

It's important to grasp that our perceptions of all things, whether themselves are constant of in flux, are coming from the karmic seeds in our minds. Then we can relate to the universe wisely.

We can either compulsively take in what our past provide us, or embrace the bold endeavor of planting new karmic seeds for a perfect world of freedom.
