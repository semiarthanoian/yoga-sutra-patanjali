# To See The Illusion

> People possessed of discrimination which come from revelation are no longer at a loss. They now have a method to accomplish this dissolution and carry them to the end of seventh level.

And so, we relate to the objects around us as though we owned them, as though we could manage them in a moment. It's obvious to the fact that we are completely at the mercy of whatever karmic seeds we have planted in the past, completely at the mercy of how we have treated others.

Seers do not relate to the world this way. During the period after their initial revelation, those ancient powerful karmic seeds of ignorance in their minds still make the things around them seem as if they are happening to them, not from them.

But the seer now know that the reality can't be that way. And so, in a way, they see the illusion for what it is - even if they can't stop it yet.

Seers, because they have seen, possess all the tools they need to dissolve all the Great Mistakes. Like a vehical, this knowledge carries them through six advanced levels, where they perfect the virtue of giving, ethical living, patience, spiritual effort, deep meditation, and higher wisdom.

During the seventh level, they manage to stop things from even looking like they come from their own side.
