# Relationship and Possessiveness

> If we make it a way of life, always to keep sexual purity, then we will always have strength.

For keeping sexual purity, a simple rule of thumb is always to act around another person's partner as if that another person were standing there too.

It's like respecting other people's things. If everyone understood it, then everyone in the world would have all they need. Poverty would be forever eradicated - and this is the only way it will ever occur.

The word "strength" here implies both very good health in general and energy for everything we do.

> If we perserver in overcoming possessiveness, we will be able to see our other lifetimes.

If we learn not to clutter up our lives with things and business, the mind becomes so still and clear that we can see future events and even other lifetimes. A wonderful skills for success at every level of life.
