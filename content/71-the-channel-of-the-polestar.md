# The Channel of the Polestar

> Turn the effort upon the polestar, and we can understand the working of the galaxy.

The center channel, colored like crystal flame, runs up and down the body like the great axis around which the stars turn. It follows the line of the spine from its bottom to the tip of the head, curving down to a point between eyebrows.

Tied to the wind in this channel are all of our celestial thoughts. And the most important thing is that this in itself will literally create a perfect world.

The three channels are joined together below the area of our navel - the Hara chakra.

Simply reading and understanding the words on this page - withdraws inner winds out of the troublesome side channels and directs them into the center channel - this in turn further reveals to us the workings of the two realities.

When all the inner winds dissolves into the center channel, the body changes to light, and we stand upon all worlds. And this is the true purpose of all types of yoga.
