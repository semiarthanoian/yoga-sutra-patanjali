# How to Breath

> Keep a close watch on the breath - outside or inside, paused or being exchanged. Observe too the place in the body - the duration and the count, long and fine.

So breath is connected to the inner winds which are linked to our very thoughts. This means that if we keep a close watch on our breath - then we can monitor the state of our mind, and monitor the condition of those two channels.

If we think about it, breath can be in three places:
- all breathed out, when it pauses momentarily;
- all breathed in, again a pause;
- or moving between these two states.

We strive to keep our breaths long and slow, with a constant even in flow and exhale, all the time. This keeps the inner winds calm and thus our mind is clear and focused.

When we're nervous or upset, inhales tend to go much quicker than exhales. We correct this by mentally counting the seconds for each, until inhales and exhales take equal time - then extend the calm exhales further.

Since the inner winds are tied to our thoughts, with proper training we can also mentally direct a certain number of breaths through specific inner blockages - and then the inner winds will follow.
