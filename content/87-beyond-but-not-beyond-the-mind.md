# Beyond But Not Beyond The Mind

> Since the two states of mind are distinct from one another, they take separate routes to experience this one same basis.

If emptiness is the single important thing - the foundation which allows all other things to happen - then why is it so difficult for us to grasp?

For the answer, we return to the Great Mistake. We've said all along that - on one level - every single perception we ever have is mistaken.

For approaching the foundation truth of emptiness, there are two instruments we're using:
- One is reasonsing - like an actor in a moving explaining to the audience how the movie can't be real.
- Another is self-defective - sort of listening and watching the mind from a little independent corner of it.

And the direct experience of Ultimate Reality during meditation is triggered by the purest karmic seeds.
