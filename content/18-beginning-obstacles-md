# Beginning Obstacles

> Obstacles occur when the mind is distracted.

We have too much to think about. It's all our own choice but it may get worse under certain conditions. Here begins a list of major obstacles on the path of spiritual seekers:

- Unpleasantness of the body
- Dullness of the mind
- And Carelessness

Unpleasantness of the body is obviously an obstacle but it's also a spiritual practice. It inspires us to work on what's really important in life, and makes us more humble and sympathic.

Dullness of the mind comes from lacking of intensive concentration and resting of the system, and so incorrect meditation. It keeps our mind from operating quickly and cleanly.

Carelessness means not staying aware of how our actions affect others and ourselves.
