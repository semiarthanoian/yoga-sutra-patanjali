# How Things Neither Begin nor End ?

> These are called transformations because that creates a change in the very condition of the qualities of things, whether their external elements or internal powers. All these things follow upon a single fact they possess - neither their beginning nor their ending can ever be pointed to.

It's crucial to realize that the act of understanding a thing can transform its very condition. The Masters who truly understands external physical elements of a water can, through tat act of understanding, can change the water into something and walk upon it. And by understanding the powers of senses, they can see and hear around the world and cure people.

All such transformations are possible because all things are as they are at the mercy of one other thing:
- A man is an active woman.
- A woman is an inactive man.
- Pride and Shame is not the opposite but the source of each other.
- Success and Failure is not the opposite but the source of each other.

And this is the fact that nothing ever begins or ends. Nor does it pass through any other stage like staying.
