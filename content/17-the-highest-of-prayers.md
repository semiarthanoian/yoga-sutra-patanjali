> With this, we will gain the ability to focus the mind within, and to avoid all obstacles.

Those lines are about mantras. A mantra is a short, essential prayer that make wishes come true. And it only works if two conditions are fulfilled:

- The mantra must come from a true holy person.
- And the person saying it must have good intentions toward others.

There are countless kinds of mantras or prayers. The very highest prayer is simply to call upon the Transcended Beings' names with our mind focused upon how they will help us understand where things are really coming from.

Even just chanting their names quietly througout the day is enough. This can keep our mind focus within and less wrapped up in the outside experiences.

Because of the extraordinary power that comes when a master and a spiritual discipline honor and serve each other purely, all obstacles in our path will melth away.

We can add the word "Om" before their names. This sacred sound is made of three parts: "a-a", "o-o", "m-m". It represent totally pure actions, words, or thoughts - we will use to help others to reach the end of the five paths.
