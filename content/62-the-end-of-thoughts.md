# The End of Thoughts

> The stopping occurs according to whether the karmic seeds for rising or remaining - are surpressed or manifested. It's duration thus follows upon the mind. The termination, or elimination, of negativities due to this also depends upon the seeds.

One day, after much practice and study, and after plating enough necessary karmic seeds by serving others - then we rise into an extra-ordinary meditation. Outside of time itself, we commune with Ultimate Reality, for the first time, in a brief while.

During the meditation, the Great Mistake has stopped for a while. We can only "stay" as long as our karmic seeds allow us. There is no conscious effort to awaken.

Stopping the Great Mistake completely, even for only a brief while, eliminates certain negative thoughts forever. Again, the eternal absence also relies on karmic seeds.
