# Why Things Fall Apart ?

> The torment of change is caused by those same karmic seeds of suffering.

Why do things fall apart? It's the problem with the way life itself designed. It's that karmic seed thing again.

When we meet a new nice friend, it's the result of a karmic seed ripening within our own mind. Every minute we spend with our new friend, this seed is wearing out, simply by producing our friend.

As the karmic seed wear out, the relationship changes. When the seed putters to an end, so does the friendship.

When we understand how karmic seeds work, we stop mis-understanding friends.

Everything comes from the karmic seeds.

> And stopping how the mind turns things around to have qualities of their own, allows us to discern how every part of our lives suffering.

Everything comes from the karmic seeds, and seeds die by sprouting. Truly then, every part of our lives - even the good things - must one day cause us suffering and pains. This is the second truth - the Truth of Suffering and Pains.
