# The Two Reality

> The phase that things exhibit are the following:
> - Differentiated and Undifferentiated
> - Mere Signs or Beyond Signs.

For convenience of working with the mind, we can see the universe as two parts - two realities:

## Deceptive Reality

Things in this reality seem different from each other, in and of themselves. We are not each other. We are not innately and by definition different.

## Ultimate Reality

On this level, things are not different. This is not some vague sentiment that everything is one. It's not, and we can't get any where with that. Rather, all things are one thing in a sense that they all come from our karmic seeds.

> Earlier on, we caught our mind imposing  a perfect little picture of a pot onto the mere signs of a pot out there on the stove - silver color, round shape.

When we understand thus how the Deceptive Reality works, it leads us to see the Ultimate Reality. But we can't stay there without the right karmic seeds.
