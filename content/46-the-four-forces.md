# The Four Forces

> They are lesser, or medium, or greater power. Say to ourselves then, "Who knows what pain we have planted for ourselves ? Sit down and work the antidote."

There is a way to surpress old negative karmic seeds. Otherwise things would be hopeless, since mental seeds constantly multiply in strength. A single acorn produces an oak tree weighing thousands of pounds, and mental seeds are no different.

Identify the most powerful negative karmic seeds we have. Older ones that are causing serious pains and sufferings. Newers ones that you remember planting - a particularly serious harm to someone - or something done in extreme emotion - an injury to a powerful karmic object such as a parent or teacher.

The antidote is called the Four Forces:
- Sit down first, and quietly review all our understandings about karmic seeds. Think about our perfect destiny to gain ability to help the whole.
- Secondly, give some intelligent regret - not guilt - about how this action and its karmic seed will delay our perfect destiny.
- Thirdly, decide not to repeat the mistake. For a health or relationship problem, we obviously need to trictly avoid any harm to other's well-being, or friendships, and so on.
- The fourth force is to take a positive action to counteract the negative one, mentally, physically.

Consciously dedicate all four forces to the karmic seed and it will dissolve.
