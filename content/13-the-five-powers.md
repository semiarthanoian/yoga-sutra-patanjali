# The Five Powers

> The powers we must first use: Awareness, Meditation, Wisdom, Belief, and Effort.

We want to be the people who follow the right way of meditation and practice to go beyond our gross physical body. To do this, we need to use the five powers that speed us along the Path of Preparation.

## Awareness

On one level is to be in the present: here and now, not wrapped up in what's happened or might happen.

On another level, is watching that whatever we do, or say, or think, is something noble.

On the highest level, is to keep our mind on where things that happen to us are really coming from.

## Meditation

Here is the ability to stay in deep thought on this question: Where things really come from?

## Wisdom

And asking the question above within the meditation is wisdom itself.

## Belief

This is not blind faith, but rather a deep attraction for the abundance of our spiritual life. Once we've heard about Trancended Beings or Sacred Beings like Buddhist Mahasattva, we can reach them and pray for their blessing.

## Effort

Once we know how a spiritual experience is, effort then comes naturally. We'll naturally go through serious practices more and more.
