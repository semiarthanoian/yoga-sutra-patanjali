# Why We Suffer ?

> Pains and suffering are riding ourselves of that would have come to us in the future.

It's crucial to realize that karmic seeds act just like physical seeds. Noone puts a seed into the ground and stand there expecting a tree to pop-up in a day or two.

Karmic seeds are planted in the mind - simply by being aware that we are doing, or saying, or thinking something towards someone else. The seeds enter the storehouse and wait to be called up, like airplane standing in the line to take off.

Certain seeds, like priority flights, get to move ahead of the others in line. For example, if we have said something out of terrible anger, or done a kind deed with and intense understanding of how seeds themselves work.

In actual, anything good we ever do always comes back good. When it seems differently, that's just another karmic seed take of in the between because of its priority.
