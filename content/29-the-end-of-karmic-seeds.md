# The End of Karmic Seeds

> The mental karmic seeds thus created cuts off all other seeds. And when mental seeds are surpressed this way, everything is stopped. Thus it is known as deep meditation where we no longer have those karmic seeds.

Now we have new karmic seeds that cut off all our old negative seeds - both those that causes the Great Mistake and those that prevent us from knowing all things.

One vast group of the new karmic seeds creates a paradise around us, where we dwell forever with everything and everyone. We enter this heaven wherever we are, without leaving or coming.

Another vast group of karmic seeds acts spontaneously, without any conscious thought on our part, to send us out to help billions of suffering beings. We appear at their side, in whatever way they need to survive - as a small animal being, as their loved ones, as a spiritual guidance.

We do all this without stirring from a perfectly still and pure state of being. We are perfect knowledge which - by merely plating the karmic seeds - makes itself continue.
