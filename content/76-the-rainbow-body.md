# The Rainbow Body

> When we loosen the ties which bind us, and know that this is a prison, then we can send our mind to enter another body.

We dearly love our gross physical body, but imagine how they would seem to a person whose body had already transcended into light? - Sort of a slimly prison, a dangerous place to be stuck in.

Incidentally, the Masters maintain their general outer forms as human beings even their body changed into light. That's how we see them. But advanced seers see the Masters as the most exquisite beings.

And so, sometimes the body of light is called "rainbow body"; Because from a distance a rainbow look like solid stuff, but up close we can pass our hand through it.

The Masters who really understands and untouched by karmic seeds could take on various outer forms and appear to be born as various different people. They know it's easier for us, on a day-to-day level, to relate to someone fairly much like ourselves. And so, at the very beginning, they come to us that way.
