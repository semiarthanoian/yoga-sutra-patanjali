# The True Source of Powers

> The powers originally are to be found in compassion. If we turn the eye of wisdom on true cause, we can gain the ability to perceive even very subtle things.

In order to be of service to others, the extra-ordinary powers come to us by planting enough good karmic seeds. And so the Master remind us of the very most powerful way to plant these seeds - the practice of the four infinite thoughts from the first chapter:

- Infinite Kindness - the desire to help all living beings to find their essential needs to survive.
- Infinite Compassion - the decision to heal every living beings from their pains and suffering.
- Infinite Joy - the decision to bring all living beings to higher form of happiness which is unconditional and eternal.
- Infinite Equanimity - the decision to help every living beings this way - not just our friends and family. This begins with avoiding extremes of emotions - happy when we feel well or stress when we don't.

When we transcend to reach our perfect destiny, we will have ultimate powers to help everyone: ultimate compassion, knowledge of all things, and the ability to show up any where in the universe at any time.

Ultimate Compassion is the true evolution of all the powers.
