# The Channel of The Moon

> We can gain the understanding of the arrangement of the stars if we turn the same effort upon the Moon.

To the left side of the center channel, runs the channel of the Moon. This channel is milky-colored compared to the blood red of the Sun channel. The inner wind within this channel runs all of our thoughts based on liking.

Stilling the wind within this channel will free us from mis-understanding the subtle reality - the mind. The mis-understanding here is the tendency to think that something comes from its own side and not from our karmic seeds.
