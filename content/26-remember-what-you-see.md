# Remember What You Saw

> When we grasp an object by mixing up the word into the image, then that is the type of balanced meditation.

We commune briefly with the Ultimate Reality and then come back to our normal state of mind with the Great Mistake - seeing things the wrong way.

Except that now we know what we're doing wrong. We don't believe how we're seeing things, and thus there's a sense of illusions going on.

> Staying in that one pure thought and never forget it: Things are empty of what they are by themselves.

At this point, the second step of the Path of Seeing, we must try to remember what we saw - things are empty.

Empty doesn't mean that nothing exist. It only means that what we thought was there isn't there - no more than a man on a movie screen.

> This is the clear light beyond all conceptual thoughts.

The mind in our normal state of the Great Mistake - mistakes words. All are the perfect little mental pictures which the karmic seeds make for actual objects. This in itself is thinking conceptually "here".
