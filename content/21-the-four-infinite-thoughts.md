# The Four Infinite Thoughts

> And if we want to pass through these obstacles, there is one, and only one, crucial practice for doing so.

The crucial practice which can help us pass through all obstacles is called the Four Infinite Thoughts. They're called "infinite" because - in the end - we'll see infinite creatures on infinite worlds with our own mind in a sense of infinite compassion for a moment.

> We must detach from all pains and dwell again in true and unconditional happiness - and we must desire to do so.

We must use these four infinite thoughts:

- Infinite Kindness
- Infinite Compassion
- Infinite Joy
- Infinite Equanimity

## Infinite Kindness

It's the desire to help all living beings to find their essential needs to survive.

## Infinite Compassion

It's the decision to heal every living beings from their pains and suffering.

## Infinite Joy

It's the decision to bring all living beings to higher form of happiness which is unconditional and eternal.

## Infinite Equanimity

It's the decision to help every living beings this way - not just our friends and family. This begins with avoiding extremes of emotions - happy when we feel well or stress when we don't.
