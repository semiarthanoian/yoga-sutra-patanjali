# The Power to Save

> The eye of wisdom allows one to see both past and future. At some point, we are able to sort out the confusion, where factors such as terms and objects are mixed up, one with the other. If we do turn the effort on this, we can gain the ability to know all the languages of all living kinds.

If things actually begin only due to a tiny mental picture we impose upon two otherwise unrelated micro-seconds, then what things become when they finish beginning has to come from the same place. 

When we truly understand this, we can turn stone into crystal. But, with unbearable emotional and physical pains that tears every single person in the world, we would be compelled to use the ability for higher purposes.

If one moment in time is only a perception, then all moments are, and we could learn to see ahead and backwards in time, to help people.

We would then gain power over words themselves, since the mental pictures are what words are. We can speak to all people, guide all people, in their own languages.

Transforming past and future karmic seeds into present ones, we can describe to people events of their past lives. So they can understand how everything comes from the seeds we've planted.
