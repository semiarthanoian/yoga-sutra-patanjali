# Is It Wrong to Like Things

> Assailed by what feels good, we begin to like things. Assailed by what doesn't feel good, we begin to dislike things.

It's not wrong to like things. Spiritually advanced people enjoy things so much more than we can. And the very ability to like and dislike gets us to the path of seeking enlightenment.

> Grasping is a thought that comes all on it own, even for those who understand and it grows ever stronger.

Grasping here means ignorance as it mis-understands an object in the moment. And hence there's a difference - between - being conscious of liking and disliking - and - being compulsive dwelling in liking and disliking.
