# The Loneliness of Seeing

> This thing belong to a person who has seen. What is dissolved for one who have reached this goal, is not dissolved for others - for they still possess the foundation.

Only a person who has directly seen the Ultimate Reality can understands the two realities. And the seer devotes the rest of their life to help others see the Ultimate Reality, too.

The experience is called "indescriable" because the seer convey it to other persons in words but can't make them see it by their own experiences. 

And this is because the simple act of seeing, if only for a number of minutes, dissolve certain negative karmic seeds immediately and all others not long afterwards, bringing the freedom that all of us so desperately need.

In hours after we first see, we pass through a series of extra-ordinary visions. One of these is seeing directly into the future, to the day when we become a Transcended Being who can help all other living creatures. And so, all doubts about our future, for example, vanish forever.

These two are very personal experiences which can never be conveyed to those who have not seen. However much the seer may want to share them, however much they may say or write, they cannot remove every last doubt of those who have yet to shatter the Great Mistake.
