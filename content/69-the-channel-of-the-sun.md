# The Channel of The Sun

> Turn the eye of wisdom towards the Sun, and we will understand the Earth.

Back in the second chapter, we mentioned three main channels where inner winds or prana travel through the body. The center channel follows the spine. Slightly to our right of it runs the channel of the Sun.

Tied to the wind of this channel are these thoughts - anger, hatred, jealous, ... all based on disliking. Stilling the wind within this channel will free us from mis-understanding our gross reality - the world, the earth.

The beauty of yoga is that we work on this channel simply and effectively through selected physical yoga excercises. Breath control practiced with authentic guidance further achieves this goal.

And we can also use the eye of wisdom to still this channel from the inside.
