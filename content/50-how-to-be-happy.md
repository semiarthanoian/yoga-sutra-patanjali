# How to Be Happy ?

> If we stay content, then we achieve true happiness - which is unsurpassed.

The karmic seeds for being happy and for accumulating wealth are different. The seeds that are planted by training ourselves to be satisfied with any level of material comfort is the ones for being happy.

These seeds ripen as pure contentment and it's worth a huge amount of wealth seeds. People who are content with simplicity have surpassed wealth itself.

> Embracing spiritual hardships - dissolve impurities, allowing us to master both body and senses.

The decision to commit ourselves to something that is truly meaningful - forces a lot of old dangerous karmic seeds to go off permanently. It's sort of like inconvenience of missing a "chance" but the chance was actually a mis-fortune.
