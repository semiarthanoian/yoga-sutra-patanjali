# Yoga Sutra: The Essential Yoga

Patanjali - a yogi, a dancer, a thinker, and a doctor.

> This is a short book about yoga which is well known as The Yoga Sutra of Master Patanjali.

A sutra is a short book which tells us the very crux of something - ideas tied tight together, with a stitch of thread. The Yoga Sutra is the mother book of all yoga. It was written about two thoudsand years ago, by Master Patanjali.

Master Patanjali was a great yogi. He knew the physical Poses of Yoga and the Art of Breathing - called Yoga of the Body. He was also a great thinker, a meditator - a Master of Yoga of the Mind. He wrote as well famous books on medicine and on Sanskrit - the ancient tongue from which almost all of our languages come from. He is recognized as well as the father of the classical dance of India.

> Dancers, doctors, yogis, thinkers, masters of ancient worlds.. What do they have in common?

Yoga, as we'll see, has many meaning. One is the union of the winds within our inner body. We unite these winds with our Yoga, when we think, pray, and perceive the Ultimate Truth. The inner winds will sing and flow free within us. They'll make our vibrations lighter and flows to heal others.
