# Ultimate Obstacles

> The ultimate obstacles come from mistaken views of the existence which are left incorrected, failing to reach specific levels of practice, or not being established firmly.

How we view the existence is - in the end - the only thing that decides whether we suffer or find true happiness. If our view of the existence is causing pain and suffering to others and ourselves, then we must look for another one.

True Yoga is the search for a view that works - to bring about true and unconditional happiness.
