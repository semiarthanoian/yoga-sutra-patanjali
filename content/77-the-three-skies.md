# The Three Skies

> When we turn the combined effort upon the relationship between the hearing and the space, we can gain the advanced ability of hearing.

> When we turn this effort upon the relationship between the substances and the space, we can gain the power of meditation.

The word "space" here had three meaning in ancient times:
- the distance between things,
- the unchanging thing which objects enter, stay in, then exit,
- the absence of something we thought was there when we realize that everything around us is not coming at us but from us.

With the combined effort turned on it:
- seeing how this space allow us to hear,
- seeing how this space allow us to be there.

This will allows us to adjust the "switches" on both these objects - the relationships:
- unheard switched to heard,
- heavy switched to light.

In the end, the mind flies free through the sky of what was never there anyway. And we use the resulting powers, first to help a limited number of people. AS we grow, the number becomes infinite. All the powers evolve this way - from mundane, to helpful, to enlightened.
