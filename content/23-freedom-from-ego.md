# Freedom from Ego

> It also makes our mind free from desires and our presence radiant like starlight.

The Four Infinite Thoughts ultimately trigger the Ultimate Compassion. This compassion begins when we quite seriously believe that it is possible for any normal person like us to become someone who can help countless people at once.

For a time, even now, this compassion is just as an idea. But it gets stronger after much thought and training, and one day it will burst into the direct experience of ultimate reality.

For almost all people, the inner channels at the heart chakra are tangled and blocked. At the first instant of Ultimate Compassion, the inner energy break free in crystal-colored light from the chakra.

When it does, then for a brief of time, we can actually see the face of every living being, not just in our world but in countless universes. And in this moment, we see as well that we will spend every hour of the rest of our life living beyond this one, and learning to take care of each one of these beings.

We are freed forever from selfishness and from wanting anything other than the Ultimate Compassion.
