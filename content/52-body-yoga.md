# Body Yoga

> The yoga poses bring a feeling of well-being which stays with us. They do so through a balance of effort and relaxation - and through endless forms of meditation.

Originally, these were mostly different types of meditation postures and few additional excercises that would give us strength and flexibility to sit in unmoving meditation for long periods of time.

By placing the parts of our body in very specific positions, we purposefully affect the inner channels. This facilitates the flows of inner winds - or prana.

And because our very thoughts ride upon this prana inside the channels, we bring greater kindness and knowledge to our mind by using our body.

With regular practice, our body and mind achieve well-being which really lasts. Ultimately, we attain a higher well-being as the channels themselves transform into light.
