# How We Hear Ourselves Think

> Whether the mind is aware of an object or not - depends upon its exposure to that object.

If we think about it a moment, it's clean that - the only way we can say that something exists is whether we can perceive it. Perharps not always directly, but at least through its effects - like we "see" the wind blowing through the trees.

If there is a higher reality which can save us and the world, which underlies all things, then it must be able to support a perception of it.

Objects depend on subjects, and subjects rest upon objects. Neither can exist without the other. It's not true that we can never see the truth.

Everyone, regardless of their spiritual level, is watching their mind working all the time. It's not true that we cannot watch our own mind by true self.

Our physical senses defect outer stimuli. Our mental sense defects inner worlds and images. In the next mili-second, these as a group are presented to the mirror of our mind - and we see the world and ourselves.
