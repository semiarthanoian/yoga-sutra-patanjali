# Inner and Outer

> The mind flies off, with that comes suffering in the body, unhappiness thougth, and the breath falling out of rhythm.

Yoga is also the union of the inner and outer methods for reaching total purity. This union depends upon the connection between our physical outer body and our spiritual inner presence.

Our entire being consists different layers of the existence which have different densities and can be grasped with different level of understanding:

- The outer most layer is the gross physical body which is created by the experiences reported by the five aggregates.
- The next layer is subtle and called the breath body which supplies energy to the gross layer.
- The next one is a layer of subtle physical energy called "prana" or "inner winds" which are stored in the five aggregates.
- The "prana" flows throughout our system in the next layer - a network of tiny tubes or channels more subtle than the finest light. Upon the flows in these channels ride our thoughts themselves.
- The inner most layer is like a rider atop a horse - the amazing frontier where our mind and body meet.

In a negative case, problems at one layer affect all the others:

- If our thoughts are not stable, this disturb the inner flows upon which they ride;
- This then disturbs the breath and cause nervous;
- This then causes unpleasantness of the gross body;
- This then again may set off unhappiness thoughts.

Here we see a continous downward spiral. The outer excercises and inner meditation of yoga reverse this cycle.
