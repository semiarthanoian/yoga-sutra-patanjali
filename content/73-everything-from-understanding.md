# Everything from Understanding

> Turn the eye of wisdom upon the radiance at the tip of the head, we can see the powers. All of them come from total understanding.

The inner wheels or chakras begin as chokepoints. And the very act of focusing upon them with understanding release the tightness of the two sides channel wrapped around them.

If we work on a chokepoint with thoughts of knowledge and caring for others, inner winds leave the side channels that causes the chokepoint in the first place. The chakra then becomes a center of radiance and high spiritual realizations.

Using this method, we can release a radiant, white, honey-like substance within the chakra at the tip of our head. This triggers worldly powers, and then divine ones.

Again, all the powers ultimately support and also spring from a clear understanding of the karmic seeds as they create the world.

> Turn it upon the heart, we will know the mind.

Within the chakra at the heart, lies an indestructible drop of consciousness - infinitely smaller than the tip of a needle. Herein lies the storehouse of billions of karmic seeds, projecting forth our life.

When the heart chakra is open, ultimate compassion burst forth as crystal light.
