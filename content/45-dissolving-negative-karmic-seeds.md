# Dissolving Negative Karmic Seeds

> When the image starts to hurt you, sit down and work the antidote.

So, Self-aware restrains new negative karmic seeds and Commitment plants new good ones. But we must also deal with old negative seeds stocked in our mental storehouse. Otherwise they will create obstacles for the other six practices of Yoga.

> The image - people who hurt us or the like - come from what we did ourselves - or got others to do for us - or what we was glad to hear that others had done.

We may not be able to see what we originally did to plant the karmic seeds we have now. But we can decide what we must have done, from how these seeds are sprouting and creating painful pitures in our current health and relationships.

All karmic seeds for suffering - whether outright pains or happiness which decays into pains - are planted through the Great Mistake as we respond to the events and people around us with mistaken feelings of liking and disliking things that actually come from ourselves.
