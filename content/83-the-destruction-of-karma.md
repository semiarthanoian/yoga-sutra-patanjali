# The Destruction of Karma

> When we correct the mistaken attitude, then the mind is released from the idea of "one or many". Herein lies the destruction of the storehouse attained through high meditation.

The one most important power from the last chapter was the ability to emanate - sending ourselves out to help one person, and later on infinite people.

Each requires a certain state of mind called "emanation state". We can only enter this state because of its nature too. That is, it's produced by our kindness towards others.

A popular excercise in ancient time, for planting the necessary karmic seeds for the state was called "neither one nor many".

We can't see a vehicle without looking at its parts. But we can have all the individual parts of a vehicle and still not have a complete and usable vehicle. So the parts are not the vehicle. Then where is the vehicle itself coming from?

Grasp this about our mind itself. Grasp this about the idea of sending out countless emanations of ourselves to help people - and we are half way there.

Meditating upon how things really work, will dissolve the store house of negative seeds. By the act of understanding, we change the very quality of things.

And then we must become as gardeners, gardening both planting flowers and stopping weeds.
