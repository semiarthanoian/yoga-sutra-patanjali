# Learning from Seeing

> Those who have experienced the extra-ordinary vision, never stop meditation upon the way the self really is. Engrossed then in discrimination, the mind is carried on towards total purity.

In Master Patanjali's time, people didn't relate to books like in our time of modern society. They see a relationship with a really meaningful book as a marriage. They read it, studied it - probably memorize most or all of it. They kept it with them, as a friend for getting help, their entire life.

Now we have read this book, we need to use it. We need to get through the five paths that every seeker must travel. We need to study it carefully and seek out for guidance. We need to spend a lot of time thinking about karmic seeds and especially the idea of emptiness.

We'll need to plant new karmic seeds to grasp all this. Be compassionate toward others and dedicate it to the understanding. Learn to meditate properly and work towards gaining ultimate compassion and seeing the Ultimate Truth.
