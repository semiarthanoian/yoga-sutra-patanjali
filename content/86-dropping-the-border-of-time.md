# Dropping the Border of Time

> It comes because those who understand things have broken through the idea that past and future are times that could exist in and of themselves. Since all the possible permutations of things are but one, their basis is emptiness.

Ancient Masters were able to establish that - the impression of time passing is actually caused by 65 separate images going off in our mind every fingersnap.

How differently we see time pass through - at the disliking period or at the liking period - depends only upon our karmic seeds. It is the emptiness of the factor - time.

Those who see these subtle details can define their own time, by gardening their mental storehouse.
