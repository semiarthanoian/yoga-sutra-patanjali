There are three primary wind channels within the body. The middle runs down the center of the back, following the spine. On either side of it, runs two lesser channels. The winds which run in two side channels are tied with deceptive thougths mis-taken how our world works.

The incredible magic of Body Yoga is that it actually dissolves deceptive thoughts on physical level. Because the excercises release blockages of inner winds in the side channels.

These blockages cause us to see things in a polarized way - this and that, me and you, "what I need" and "what you need". When the blockages are freed, then "getting what I need" and "getting what you need" become "getting what we need". And we are both freed.
